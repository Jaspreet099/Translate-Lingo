## The idea behind this:
I always wonder if we can have a translator, AI listener, and speech converter all in one place. And I made it happen. Itâ€™s a beginner project and I welcome you all to contribute in this.

## Features:
You can translate any text into 30 different languages and copy that resulting text.

You can record text and AI will write it for you. You have a pause button and a reset option there as well.

You can save time by doing the second step.

Also, you can type and listen to your text

## Future plans:
Providing voice translation so that users can speak and then translate into another language.

Adding download functionality in Text-to-Speech so that user can download the AI voice and use it to make reels or videos.

## How you can contribute?
If you find these project innovative and have ideas to make it even better, you can go to the github of this project and raise an issue. In this way, we all can build a useful websiteðŸ’¥

Looking forward to get active response on this. Hope you all use it wiselyðŸ’œ

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
